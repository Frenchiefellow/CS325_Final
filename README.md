CS325_Final
===========
Craigslist Rework for CS325 - Fall 2014. 

Temporarily Hosted: http://cs325final.net16.net

<h1> Description </h1>
For our final project in CS325 (Usability), we were tasked with improving upon the design of an exisiting website or piece of software, so to bestow it with a new and improved UI (along with some changes in core functionality, if need be) to vastly improve the UX.

We decided to endeavor into Craigslist; a site desperately needing a new UI. This repo details our progress thus far. 

<strong>NOTE:</strong> This "site" is meant to be a high fidelity prototype and will not contain most of the logic and functionality required to be the "full" Craigslist site. This project is meant to demonstrate how a new UI will improve the UX of the site.
