<H1>Description 
</H1>
<P>For our final project in CS325 (Usability), we were tasked with
improving upon the design of an exisiting website or piece of
software, so to bestow it with a new and improved UI (along with some
changes in core functionality, if need be) to vastly improve the UX.
We decided to endeavor into Craigslist; a site desperately needing a
new UI. This repo details our progress thus far.

<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG>
This &quot;site&quot; is meant to be a high fidelity prototype and
will not contain most of the logic and functionality required to be
the &quot;full&quot; Craigslist site. This project is meant to
demonstrate how a new UI will improve the UX of the site. 

That said, many links do not work and there are some very specific functional paths.
